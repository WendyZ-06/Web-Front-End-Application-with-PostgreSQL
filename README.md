# Web Front-End Application

## Introduction
This is an online marketplace web application.

The app allows you to create an account and log in to the app, where the users are separated into two groups, seller and buyer. As a user, you can see your order history, search for a product and its details including reviews, and buy a product; as a seller, you can see what items you are selling, post a product, and delete a product from your product list.

## Materials
1. `server.py` includes the code needed to run the application;
2. `templates` contains all the html files needed for the design.


#### Note
Every time you run the application, remember to fill in all the blanks required. Although the boxes have a default value, it is not an actual input, so you need to fill in it even if the default value is your choice.
